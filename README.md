Project Overview: Unveiling valuable insights from Zomato, a popular restaurant platform, requires the power of Python. Libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib become your allies in this task. Pandas helps you wrangle the Zomato data into a structured format, while Matplotlib brings it to life with informative visualizations. Through data exploration and analysis, you can uncover hidden trends. Perhaps you’ll identify popular cuisines by location or explore how pricing influences ratings. Python empowers you to ask questions of the data and uncover knowledge that can benefit both restaurants and diners.
Objectives
•	Collect and preprocess Zomato data.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
•	Visualize data using Matplotlib or Seaborn to uncover insights.
Skills Demonstrated
•	Data wrangling and preprocessing using Pandas.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
